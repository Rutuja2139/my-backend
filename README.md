# Excel Data Analytics Backend

This repository contains the **backend code** for an Excel Data Analytics web application developed during my internship  project.

The backend handles user authentication, Excel file uploads, parsing and processing data, and providing APIs for the frontend to generate charts and visualizations.

This project demonstrates my skills in **backend development, REST API design, debugging, and working with real-world data**.



# Tech Stack

- Node.js  
- Express.js  
- MongoDB  
- JWT for authentication  
- Multer for file uploads  
- SheetJS (xlsx) for Excel parsing  
- Postman for API testing  



# Features

- JWT-based authentication (Login / Signup)  
- Role-based access control for protected APIs  
- Upload and parse Excel files (.xls / .xlsx)  
- Convert tabular data into structured JSON for frontend  
- APIs to save, retrieve, and delete chart configurations  
- Validation and error handling for invalid files or missing values  



# Running Locally

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
1.git clone https://github.com/Rutuja2139/my-backend.git

2.Install dependencies:
npm install

3.Create a .env file in the root folder.

4.start the server
npm start
